1. Introduction
---------------

pgn2web is *free* software for converting PGN files to webpages that allow
you to replay the game(s) within a web browser. This software is
intended as a free cross-platform replacement for existing non-free
conversion programs.

2. Known Issues (version 0.1)
-----------------------------

This is the first release, there may be many bugs but on the whole it
should be fairly usable. The only major short-coming is that pgn2web
is unable to deal with games that start from non-standard positions
e.g. fischer-random or chess puzzles etc. Currently, variations and
comments are stripped out. Missing functionality and bugs will be
corrected in future versions.

Please email any bug reports, comments, or suggestions to me@whoggarth.com
