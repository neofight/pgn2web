1. Introduction
---------------

pgn2web is *free* software for converting PGN files to webpages that allow you
to replay the game(s) within a web browser. This software is intended as a free
cross-platform replacement for existing non-free conversion programs.

This is only the fourth release, there may be many bugs but on the whole it
should be fairly usable. Please email any bug reports, comments, or suggestions
to whoggarth@users.sourceforge.net

2. Installation
---------------

Linux
~~~~~

Installation requires that you have the wxWidgets (formerly wxWindows) library
installed. Most distributions will have a ready made package for this.

The installation is fairly standard. Simply untar the archive, change
to the resulting directory, type make, switch to root and type make install.

Mac OS X
~~~~~~~~

Simply open the disk image and copy the program to your application folder.

Windows
~~~~~~~

It is recommended that if you have a previous version of pgn2web installed that
you uninstall it first.

The Windows version is distributed as a Microsoft Installer Package. If you are
running XP or have the Windows Installer software on your system then you can
simply run the MSI file to install. If you are not running XP and do not have
the Windows Installer on your system you will need to download it from the
Microsoft Website.

3. Usage
--------

As of version 0.4 the command line interface to pgn2web is only available on
Linux. Windows and Mac OS X users should skip this section.

The syntax for pgn2web is as follows:

pgn2web <options> <pgnfile> <htmlfile>

The options being:

[-c yes|no] - include a link to the pgn2web homepage
[-p <pieces>] - use the <pieces> pieceset
[-s frameset|linked|individual] - use the specified layout 

Passing no parameters at all will simply launch the GUI version.
