1. Introduction
---------------

pgn2web is *free* software for converting PGN files to webpages that allow
you to replay the game(s) within a web browser. This software is
intended as a free cross-platform replacement for existing non-free
conversion programs.

This is only the third release, there may be many bugs but on the
whole it should be fairly usable. Please email any bug reports,
comments, or suggestions to whoggarth@users.sourceforge.net

2. Installation
---------------

Linux
~~~~~

The installation is fairly standard. Simply untar the archive, change
to the resulting directory, type make, switch to root and type make install.

3. Usage
--------

The syntax for pgn2web is as follows:

pgn2web <pgn file> <html file>
